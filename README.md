## 1 Introduction

The Compute Express Link (CXL) is an open industry standard that defines a family of interconnect protocols between CPUs and devices. While the CXL specification and short summaries by news outlets are available. 

The CXL protocol spans the entirecompute stack and touches on many branches of computer science. 

As a general device interconnect, CXL takes a broad definition of devices including graphics processing units (GPUs), general purpose graphics processing unit (GP-GPUs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), as well as a wide range of purpose-built accelerators and storage devices. Traditionally, these devices use the Peripheral Component Interconnect-Express® (PCI-Express® or PCIe®) serial interface. CXL also targets memory which is traditionally connected to the CPU through the Double Data Rate (DDR) parallel interface.
